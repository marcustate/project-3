                        <div className="answer-home">Sickle Cell Anemia is an inherited red blood cell disorder "caused by a mutation in the Hemoglobin-Beta Gene found on Chromose 11[4]". In normal individuals red blood cells are smooth and shaped somewhat like a donut without a hole in the middle. This makes them bendable so that they will easily pass through blood vessels to carry oxygen throughout the body. In sickle cell disease some red blood cells can form into sickle or crescent shapes. This makes them sticky and sharp and results in them getting stuck in blood vessel walls. [1]</div>

                        <div className="subtitle-home">Who Has Sickle Cell Anemia</div>
                        <div className="answer-home">Scientists have tracked the origin of the disease to a genetic mutation that occurred over 7,300 years ago in the Green Sahara. This mutation  came with an important advantage for people of that region in that one affected chormose can protect its carrier against malaria[5]. This disease is thus more common in certain ethnic groups:</div>

For the first 6 months of life, infants are protected largely by elevated levels of fetal hemoglobing.
